    <h2>What is Join ?</h2>
    <br />
    <span

      Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method
      to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or
      flow).
      <strong>Join</strong> leverages the principles of kanban to help users
      manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.

    <span
      >It is important to note that <strong>Join</strong> is designed as an
      educational exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage.
      While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot
      guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects
      of quality regarding <strong>Join</strong>.

        <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
        <span
          >When you log in to <strong>Join</strong>, you'll find a default
          board. This board represents your project and contains four default
          lists: "To Do", "In Progress", "Await feedback", and "Done".</span

        <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
        <span
          >In <strong>Join</strong>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your
          projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and

          assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the
          board.</span

          >Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards.
          Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the
          appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the
          card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.</span

          another.</span

        <h3>Deleting Cards</h3>
        <span
          >Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list
          or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the
          board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is
          irreversible.</span

          Remember that using <strong>Join</strong> effectively requires
          consistent updates from you and your team to ensure the board reflects
